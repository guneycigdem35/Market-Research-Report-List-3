<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Optical Encoder Ics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Transmissive Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Optical encoder ICs are devices that convert angular or linear position into a digital signal. There are two main types of optical encoder ICs: transmissive type and reflective type. Transmissive type encoder ICs consist of a light source and a detector on opposite sides of a code disk, while reflective type encoder ICs use a reflective surface on the code disk to bounce light back to the detector. Both types offer high accuracy and reliability in position sensing applications.</p></p>
