<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Resettable Fuse Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-Line</li><li>Surface Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer resettable fuses are available in two main market types: in-line and surface mount. In-line fuses are typically used in applications where space is limited and protection against overcurrent is needed. They are designed to be installed directly into the circuit. Surface mount fuses, on the other hand, are mounted directly onto the surface of a circuit board, making them ideal for high-density electronic devices. Both types provide reliable protection against overcurrent events and can be easily reset to restore functionality.</p></p>
