<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axle Counter for Train Detection Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rail Side Axle Counter</li><li>On-rail Axle Counter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Axle counters are used for train detection and are available in two market types: Rail Side Axle Counter and On-Rail Axle Counter. The Rail Side Axle Counter is installed on the side of the railway track and detects the presence of trains by counting the axles that pass by. On the other hand, the On-Rail Axle Counter is installed directly on the track itself and performs the same function of train detection by counting the axles of passing trains. Both types of axle counters are important for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of railway systems.</p></p>
