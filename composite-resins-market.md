<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Resins Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermosetting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite resins can be categorized into two main types - thermoplastic and thermosetting. Thermoplastic composite resins are materials that can be softened by heat and then moulded into different shapes when cooled. They have the ability to be reshaped multiple times. On the other hand, thermosetting composite resins are materials that undergo a chemical reaction when heated and then hardened into a final form, which cannot be reshaped. Both types of composite resins are widely used in various industries for their unique properties and applications.</p></p>
