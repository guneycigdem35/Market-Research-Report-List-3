<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Retinal Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Implants</li><li>Subretinal Implants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Retinal implants are devices designed to restore vision in individuals with retinal degenerative diseases. There are two main types of retinal implants: Epiretinal implants are placed on the surface of the retina, while Subretinal implants are positioned beneath the retina. Epiretinal implants stimulate the remaining retinal cells to create visual signals, while Subretinal implants directly stimulate the remaining retinal cells to generate images. Both types of implants hold promise for improving vision in individuals with conditions such as retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.</p></p>
