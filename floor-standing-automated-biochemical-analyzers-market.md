<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Floor-standing Automated Biochemical Analyzers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi-automated</li><li>Fully-automated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Floor-standing automated biochemical analyzers are commonly categorized into two types: semi-automated and fully-automated. Semi-automated analyzers require some manual input from laboratory technicians, such as sample loading and reagent preparation, while the actual analysis process is automated. On the other hand, fully-automated analyzers are capable of performing all steps of the analysis process without human intervention. Both types of analyzers offer high throughput and accuracy, but fully-automated analyzers are more efficient and require less oversight from technicians.</p></p>
