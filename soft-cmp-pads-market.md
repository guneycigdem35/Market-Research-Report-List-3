<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soft CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Type</li><li>Normal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Soft CMP pads can be classified into two main types: Abrasive Type and Normal Type. Abrasive Type pads are specifically designed to remove material more aggressively during the chemical mechanical planarization process, making them ideal for applications that require a high material removal rate. On the other hand, Normal Type pads are suited for general polishing and planarization processes, providing a smoother and more controlled material removal rate. Both types cater to different needs in the semiconductor industry and offer varying levels of abrasiveness and performance.</p></p>
